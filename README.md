To install the application, first of all, you have to download the code on the github page :
https://github.com/AureleSarrail/P5_OC.

You can clone using git executing the command 'git clone https://github.com/AureleSarrail/P5_OC.git'.
or you can download directly on the github page (same link).

You also have to modify your access to database in the file Model/Manager/Model.php.
This file contain only one method for dbConnect.
All you have to do is to edit it and replace <host>, <dbname>, <user> and <password> with you own.
  
if you want to see it running, you can go to www.as-dev.fr.
  
To launch the application, load in your browser the file index.php and you are good to go.

Note that the application is going to evolve in the next days/months so stay tune to that page if you want to know about the modifications.

Thank you.
